# ðŸ§  NumPy Worksheet â€“ Practice (With Answers)

## 1. Create a 1-D NumPy array with values from 5 to 25 (step = 5)
## 2. Create a 2x3 NumPy array filled with ones
## 3. Generate 6 evenly spaced numbers between 0 and 1
## 4. Create the following array and access the element at 2nd row, 3rd column from this array:

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 2 | 3 |
| 4 | 5 | 6 |
| 7 | 8 | 9 |


## 5. Create a 1-D array `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]` and slice the last 3 elements. Print the result.
## 6. Find max, min, mean, std of this array: `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`
## 7. Create a 5x5 random matrix and find elements > 0.5
## 8. Create two 3X3 random matrics and perform matrix addition, subtraction, multiplication
## 9. Create a 2-D array [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]. Change the element at 1st row, 3rd column to 10 and print the updated array.
## 10.Create two 2-D NumPy arrays `[[1, 2], [3, 4]] and [[5, 6], [7, 8]].` Use `np.concatenate()` to stack them vertically (row-wise). Print the result. `(Hint: Use axis=0.)`
